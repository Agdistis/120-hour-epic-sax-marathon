## The shell game

## You can have a butler

[Leiningen] is a project management tool for Clojure projects. It handles
building the project, declaring and fetching dependencies, opening an
interactive session inside the project, and other things.

We use Leiningen version 2 on this course. Your computer has it installed.

You can run Leiningen with the `lein` command. Leiningen will print a succinct
help listing about the commands it understands.

## Version control with Linus Torvalds

<aside class="alert alert-info">
*Note:* We use Leiningen to launch the interactive session for convenience
only. We could just as well have run `java -cp ".:/path/to/clojure.jar"
clojure.main` for the same effect. (On Windows, replace the `:` with `;`.)
Typing `lein repl` is just a bit nicer.  Additionally, Leiningen provides
commandline editing functions that running Clojure directly wouldn't. Try
typing <i class="icon-arrow-up"></i> in the interactive session launched by
Leiningen, then try it in the session launched with `java` directly.
