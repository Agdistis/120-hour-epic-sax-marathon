## Synopsis

- `if` and truthiness
- Everything is an expression / has a value

## If then else

Any non-trivial program needs conditionals. Clojure's `if` looks like the
following:

~~~ {.clojure}
(if (my-father? darth-vader)  ; Conditional
  (lose-hand me)              ; If true
  (gain-hat me))              ; If false
~~~

`if` (usually) takes three parameters: the conditional clause, the *then*
body and the *else* body. If the first parameter - the conditional clause - is
true, the *then* body is evaluated. Otherwise, the *else* body is evaluated.

Clojure has two boolean values: `true` and `false`. However, all values can be
used in a boolean context like `if`. Everything except `nil` and `false` act as
`true`. For example, all of the following are valid Clojure:

~~~ {.clojure}
(if "foo" "truthy" "falsey") ;=> "truthy"
(if 0     "truthy" "falsey") ;=> "truthy"
(if []    "truthy" "falsey") ;=> "truthy"
(if false "truthy" "falsey") ;=> "falsey"
(if nil   "truthy" "falsey") ;=> "falsey"
~~~

`nil` is Clojure's `null` value. We'll talk about it later.

To make it easier to talk about values in boolean context, we define the
following terminology:

- If a value is considered true in boolean context, we call it *truthy*.

- If a value is considered false, we call it *falsey*.

Any value can be turned into `true` or `false` with the `boolean` function:

~~~ {.clojure}
(boolean "foo")   ;=> true
(boolean nil)     ;=> false
(boolean (+ 2 3)) ;=> true
(boolean true)    ;=> true
(boolean false)   ;=> false
~~~

*Exercise:* Implement `(my-boolean x)`, which works like the built-in
`boolean` function: for `nil` and `false`, it returns `false`, and for all
other values it returns `true`. You can use `if` in its implementation.

TODO: This could be moved to a place where we actually return boolean values.

In functional programming, and specifically in Clojure, everything is an
expression. This is a way of saying that everything has a usable value.
Concretely, `if` has a return value; the value is the value of the evaluated
body (either the *then* or the *else* body).

As an example, let's define the function `(sign x)`, which returns the string
`"-"` if `x` is negative and otherwise `"+"`. The function looks like the
following:

~~~ {.clojure}
(defn sign [x]
  (if (< x 0)
    "-"
    "+"))
~~~

The function definition has one expression, which is an `if` expression. The
value of the function is the value of the `if` expression, because it is the
last expression in the function body. The value of the `if` expression is
either `"-"` or `"+"`, depending on the value of the parameter `x`.

You can paste the function into the REPL and try calling it with various
values of `x`:

~~~ {.clojure}
(sign  2) ;=> "+"
(sign -2) ;=> "-"
(sign  0) ;=> "+"
~~~

There is no need for a `return` clause -- there is no such keyword in Clojure
-- because the return value of a function is always the value of the last
expression in the body of the function.

<alert>
`if`, does *not* have a return value in a language like Java. In other words,
it is not an expression, but a clause. Because everything is an expression in
Clojure, there is no equivalent construct to Java's `if` in it.

For illustration, you could use Java's `if` to implement `sign`:

~~~ {.java}
String sign(int x) {
    if (x < 0)
        return "-";
    else
        return "+";
}
~~~

Note that you need to use the `return` keyword to indicate when to return from
the method. Compare this to Clojure, where the last expression's value will be
the function's return value. Because Java's `if` does not return a value, you
can not say:

~~~ {.java}
return if (x < 0) "-" else "+"; // Illegal Java!
~~~
</alert>

## Conditional evaluation

In any case, *only* the appropriate expression is evaluated. So the following
is not an error:

~~~ {.clojure}
(if true
  42
  (/ 1 0))
~~~

If evaluated, `(/ 1 0)` would throw an `ArithmeticException` due to the
division by zero. However, the `if` expression does not evaluate the division
at all, because the conditional clause is true and only the *then* body, `42`,
is evaluated.

<exercise>
Write the function `(abs n)`, which returns the absolute value of `n`, i.e. if
$n < 0$, the value of `(abs n)` is $- n$, and otherwise $n$.
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write the function `(fizzbuzz n)` that returns

- `"fizz"` when `n` is divisible by 3,
- `"buzz"` when `n` is divisible by 5,
- `"gotcha!"` when `n` is divisible by 15, and
- the empty string `""` otherwise.

`(mod num div)` returns `0` if `div` divides `num` exactly:

~~~ {.clojure}
(mod 10 5) ;=> 0
(mod 3 2)  ;=> 1
~~~

~~~ {.clojure}
(fizzbuzz 2)  ;=> ""
(fizzbuzz 45) ;=> "gotcha!"
(fizzbuzz 48) ;=> "fizz"
(fizzbuzz 70) ;=> "buzz"
~~~
</exercise>

## Boolean Functions

The common boolean functions in Clojure are `and`, `or` and `not`. These
roughly match the `&&`, `||` and `!` operators of languages like Java.

~~~ {.clojure}
(and true true)   ;=> true
(and true false)  ;=> false

(or  true false)  ;=> true
(or  false false) ;=> false

(not true)        ;=> false
(not false)       ;=> true
~~~

`and` and `or` take an arbitrary amount of arguments:

~~~ {.clojure}
(and true)                      ;=> true
(and true true true)            ;=> true
(and true true true true false) ;=> false
(and)                           ;=> true

(or false false false false true) ;=> true
(or false false false)            ;=> false
(or)                              ;=> nil
~~~

In addition to booleans, `and`, `or` and `not` accept non-boolean values as
arguments as well. (Remember that `false` and `nil` are falsey and everything
else is truthy.)

`and` returns truthy if all of its arguments are truthy:

~~~ {.clojure}
(and "foo" "bar")   => "bar"
(and "foo"  false)  => false
(and  10    nil)    => nil
~~~

`or` returns truthy if any of its arguments is truthy:

~~~ {.clojure}
(or  "foo"  false)  => "foo"
(or   42    true)   => 42
~~~

`not` returns `true` if its argument is falsey and `false` if its argument is
truthy:

~~~ {.clojure}
(not "foo")         => false
(not nil)           => true
(not [])            => false
~~~

This behaviour might look surprising, but it is consistent. What's happening
is that if all the arguments to `and` are truthy, it returns the value of the
last argument. Otherwise, it returns the value of the first falsey argument.
Conversely, `or` returns either the first truthy value or the last falsey
value.

While it might seem odd that boolean functions return non-boolean values,
remember that all values in Clojure in fact act as boolean values. This
behaviour is useful in many situations. For an example, it allows you to
provide default values for variables when taking input:

~~~ {.clojure}
(def server-port (or (commandline-parameters :port) 80))
~~~

<exercise>
Write the function `(teen? age)`, which returns truthy if `age` is at least 13
and at most 19. Use only one comparison operator and give it three arguments.

~~~ {.clojure}
(teen? 12) ;=> false
(teen? 13) ;=> true
(teen? 15) ;=> true
(teen? 19) ;=> true
(teen? 20) ;=> false
(teen? 27) ;=> false
~~~
</exercise>

<exercise>
Write the function `(not-teen? age)`, which returns true when teen? return
false and false otherwise.

~~~ {.clojure}
(not-teen? 13) ;=> false
(not-teen? 25) ;=> true
(not-teen? 12) ;=> true
(not-teen? 19) ;=> false
(not-teen? 20) ;=> true
~~~
</exercise>
